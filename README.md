# Get-CUOneDriveStatus
A function that grabs the latest version of Rodneyviana's "[Get-ODStatus](https://github.com/rodneyviana/ODSyncService)" function and uses My "[PSRunAsCurrentUser](https://github.com/AlecMcCutcheon/PSRunAsCurrentUser)" function there's a compatibility layer of sorts. Which allows it to work as the (User, Admin or even System) account. Note: If you are running it as Administrator or System, keep in mind that a user must be logged into the machine in order for this to work.
